# President Trump's Popularity and Twitter

### Project Proposal
On the September 10th, 2018 edition of the FiveThirtyEight politics podcast Nate Silver suspected, but admited he didn't have the data to definitively say, that President Donald Trump tweets more when his popularity is lower. Silver's hypothesis is bad news relects poorly upon President Trump, and this cause lowers the President's approval rating causing him to erratically tweet more offten. <br/>

This project looks into that data, and attempts to prove the null hypothesis that no correlation exists between the frequency of President Trump's tweets and his popularity.<br/>

### Data:
* President Donald Trump's Popularity
	* Trump's popularity will be measured by his disapproval rating from FiveThirtyEight's aggregate of polling data. Disapproval numbers are used instead of approval because seem more closely linked to bad news. (This may be something to consider in more depth, or a possible limitation of the data.)
* President Donald Trump's Tweets
	* Trump's tweeting frequency will be measured by the number of tweets he makes per day.<br/>

### Process Overview:<br/>
The Data gathered from President Trump's Twitter account, and FiveThirtyEight will be compared on a daily basis. His counted number of tweets to his disaproval numbers for the day. These numbers will be examined for correlation. If no correlation exists the null hypothesis has been proven. If there is correlation further study might be warranted to determine if frequent erratic tweets are caused by high disaproval, or if high disaproval leads to frequent tweeting. This could be done by comparing the tweet frequency to the days before and after President Trumps disaproval numbers for given days.
