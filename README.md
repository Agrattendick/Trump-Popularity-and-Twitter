# President Trump's Popularity and Twitter

On the September 10th, 2018 edition of the FiveThirtyEight politics podcast Nate Silver susspected, but admited he didn't have the data to say for sure, that President Donald Trump Tweets more when his popularity is lower. Silver's hypothesis is bad news relects poorly upon President Trump, and this cause both lowers the President's approval rating and causes him to Tweet erratically more offten. <br/>

This project looks into that data, and attempts to prove the null hypothesis that no correlation exists between the frequency of President Trump's Tweets and his popularity.<br/>

Data:
* President Donald Trump's Popularity
	* Trump's popularity will be measured by his disaproval rating from FiveThirtyEight's aggregate of polling data. 
* President Donald Trump's Tweets
	* Trump's Tweeting Frequency will be measured by the number of Tweets he makes per day.
